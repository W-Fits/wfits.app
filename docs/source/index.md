# Welcome to Clothing Processor Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the components that make up the Clothing Processor system â€” a pipeline designed to process user-submitted outfit images, generate predictions (e.g., clothing classification), and manage file storage using AWS S3.

## Contents Overview

### `clothing_processor/main.md`
This module is the entry point for the processing system. It coordinates image preprocessing, prediction logic, and result packaging. It acts as the controller that brings together utilities from the `utils` package.

### `clothing_processor/utils/image.md`
Handles image processing tasks, including:
- Resizing, cropping, and normalizing user-uploaded images.
- Preparing data in the appropriate format for prediction models.

### `clothing_processor/utils/predictions.md`
Responsible for:
- Loading machine learning models.
- Running image classification or detection.
- Outputting predicted clothing categories or attributes.

### `clothing_processor/utils/s3.md`
Interfaces with Amazon S3 to:
- Upload and retrieve images securely.
- Manage buckets and access control.
- Ensure data persistence and retrieval reliability.

### `clothing_processor/utils/files.md`
Manages local filesystem interactions:
- Handles temporary file storage.
- Cleans up unused or expired files.
- Converts file formats when needed.
